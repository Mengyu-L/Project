    <h1>INTRO OF <em>GUZHENG</em></h1>
    <p>Guzheng has a long history and is a representative instrument of traditional Chinese music. <br />
        But unlike the violin, piano and other Western traditional musical instruments, their history is not as long as Guzheng, but it quickly established its own system.<br />
         As traditional Chinese musical instruments focus on artistic conception rather than performance skills, the playing style of Guzheng has been changing with the changes of the times. <br />
         In modern times, it gradually turned to regularization and specialization. <br />
         This has made more and more musicians discover the possibility of the integration of Guzheng and Western traditional instruments, such as combining the rhythm of Guzheng with the elegance and lyricism of the violin, creates a more beautiful form of music expression. <br />
        This is also the background of this study.
